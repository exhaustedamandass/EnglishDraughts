        // Forcing a scenario where the current player has no moves:
        // One approach is to remove all Red pieces or place them in blocked positions.
        // Let's remove all Red pieces:
        for (int row = 0; row < Board.Size; row++)
        {
            for (int col = 0; col < Board.Size; col++)

                }
            }
        }

        // Act
        // Attempting to make any move is mootâ€”there's none. But let's call "GetCurrentPlayerMoves" first:
        var redMoves = game.GetCurrentPlayerMoves();
        Assert.IsEmpty(redMoves, "Red has no pieces, so no moves.");
        
        // Because the game checks for 'IsGameOver' after switching turn or making a move,
        // we can force a check by making a 'move' or by switching the turn artificially.

        // Let's try to call MakeMove with an invalid move (or any move) to trigger the logic:
        bool result = game.MakeMove(new Move(new Position(0, 0))); // guaranteed invalid

        // Assert
        Assert.False(result, "MakeMove fails with no moves available for Red.");
        // The game might set IsGameOver to true if the *current* player is checked post-turn.
        // However, the logic in CheckGameOver is triggered *after* a successful move,
        // so in this scenario, we haven't had a successful move. Another approach is to directly 
        // switch the turn and see if White has moves, etc.

        // Another approach: switch turn manually with a valid Red move, or remove White pieces. 
        // For demonstration, let's forcibly test the next turn scenario:

        // Simulate that Red is forced to pass or fails to move:
        // We can do that by forcibly toggling players:
        var current = game.CurrentPlayer;
        // If we wanted to strictly ensure IsGameOver gets set, we'd do a successful move for Red, 
        // then remove White's pieces, etc. 
        // For brevity, we'll rely on the logic that if the new current player has no moves, game is over.

        // We'll do it the simpler approach:
        // 1) Switch Turn with a valid Red move if possible, then remove White's pieces, call MakeMove again, etc.
        // But we've already removed Red's pieces, so let's just check the logic that if we 
        // remove White's pieces and the turn becomes White, it might set IsGameOver. 
        
        // Let's revert the board to re-check. We'll do a simpler test approach:
        var game2 = new Game();
        // remove White pieces:
        for (int row = 0; row < Board.Size; row++)
        {
            for (int col = 0; col < Board.Size; col++)
            {
                var cell = game2.Board.GetCellAt(new Position(row, col));
                if (!cell.IsEmpty && cell is Piece piece && piece.Owner == Player.White)
                {
                    game2.Board.RemovePieceAt(new Position(row, col));
                }
            }
        }
        // Now Red presumably has moves. Let's do one valid Red move:
        var redMoves2 = game2.GetCurrentPlayerMoves();
        Assert.IsNotEmpty(redMoves2, "Red should have moves in game2 after removing only White pieces.");
        game2.MakeMove(redMoves2[0]); // Succeeds, now it will become White's turn

        // White should have 0 moves => game over
        Assert.True(game2.IsGameOver, "Game should be over if White has no pieces (hence no moves).");
